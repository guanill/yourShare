# YourShare - Web App

## Problem statement

There's value in what communities collectively own today that's untapped. People are likely to buy something they use infrequently and there are barriers to sharing and discovering what's available in friend and community circles. How might we enable individuals to share what they own, reducing waste and creating stronger local communities.

## Summary

Today sharing economy is in the hands of large corporations who operate bike, car, and living sharing marketplaces. Free exchange of goods falls onto platforms based on ad revenue. How do we bring that back down to communities and enable neighbors and friends to get collective benefit of what they own today? YourShare enables individuals to open what they have to their circles. Lenders can post items for sharing and borrowers can find what they need to get a job done. Have a car that you don't drive daily? Have a blender you only use sometime? Post these items and let others share value in what you own. Need a weed wacker to cleanup the block? Check out YourShare to see if a neighbor can chip in. YourShare starts with individuals and grows into a community lending library.

In an effort of conservation, borrowing something reduces energy and material used in manufacturing the product and reduces the waste at the end of the product life, preventing one more thing from ending up in the landfill.
  * Number and variety of items listed on YourShare
  * User service prompt to measure if it saved a purchase
* Create local sharing economies - large companies drive the sharing economy today. YourShare gives it back to communities.
  * Adoption of YourShare with a college or university community area, % of population
* Improve resiliency of communities - communities that share can depend on another in good times and in times of trial.
  * Average number of shares over time against economic and health highs and lows
